# About
- I'm using vm_writeData.h to patch the offsets/hexes
- Kopycat some code from [joeyjurjens](https://github.com/joeyjurjens/iOS-Mod-Menu-Template-for-Theos)
- Also bring encryption from joeyjurjens template too
- Fan boi of ‰∫îÁ≠âÂàÜ„ÅÆËä±Â´Å

# Installation
- Using theos for compilation
- Add ```THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME = rootless``` to support Dopamine if you want 

# Feature
- On/Off switch for patching offsets
### Not support hooking at this time, I'll try to adding it when I have time ü´£

# Usage
**3 fingers double tap to screen to open menu, 2 fingers double tap to disable menu**
- Take a look at `5Toubun/NakanoYotsuba.h` file. I noted about ASLR issue on Dopamine/Xina/palera1n jailbreak (iOS 15 and up issue), change 0 or 1 depends on which target jailbreak you're using

Editing these in `ImGuiDrawView.mm`

- Patching offset on default binary `NULL`
```obj-c
vm(ENCRYPTOFFSET("0x10517A154"), strtoul(ENCRYPTHEX("0xC0035FD6"), nullptr, 0));
```

- Patching offset on `UnityFramework`
```obj-c
vm_unity(ENCRYPTOFFSET("0x517A154"), strtoul(ENCRYPTHEX("0x360080D2"), nullptr, 0));
```
You can change this to anything you want to patch on the line where I noted in `5Toubun/NakanoYotsuba.h`. Normally it's `UnityFramework` but some games like LoL WildRift is `FEProj`

- Font using for this menu is Honkai Star Rail font (**English only**)
